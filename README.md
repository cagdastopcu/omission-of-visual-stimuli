# omission-of-visual-stimuli

Abstract:
Garrett, 2020 (eLife) demonstrated that VIP neurons 'ramp up' during omitted visual stimuli in an image-switching detection task, and that cortical excitatory/pyramidal cells respond more strongly to the next image. We propose that by monitoring the middle-layer SST interneurons during this task that we will see that a suppression of SST activity during the omitted trial, allowing excitatory cells to respond more strongly on the next presentation. We will also look at a population analysis of the flow of inhibition in a state-space model of the population activity using clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques like principal component analysis.

We will then use the results of this 'what' model to construct a simple model of the cortical circuit and make a 'how' model of the facilitated response in pyramidal cells through disinhibition. We will model this with a semi-realistic circuit model using linear integrate and fire units and approximations of sensory inputs. We will then compare the output of the model to the observed responses in vivo to determine how the cortical circuit achieves facilitation.
